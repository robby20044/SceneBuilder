# Scene Builder

<br>

## Goal
### ➡️ Provide an easy option to make custom scenes for the 3D caves  
#### The staff requested customizable background environments. Unity is one method of making scenes for the 3D caves, but it is not very beginner friendly. A web-based environment to create scenes is quicker, easier, and makes it more accessible for anyone to create their own custom scene. 

<br>

#### The user will be able to: 
- select a background image to simulate an environment
- bring in other images to layer on top of the background
- save custom scenes and load them back up

## Current State

#### [🚧 Scene Builder 🚧](https://robby20044.github.io/SceneBuilder/index.html)

<br><br><br>

## Technologies

#### I'm using `three.js` to create the customizable scene. The scene has a 64:10 aspect ratio allowing it to span across all four walls of the 3D caves

<br><br><br>

## Challenges

#### ⚠️ Picking a format of the webpage  
#### ⚠️ Proper testing can't solely be done on a laptop
