# Scene Builder

<br>

## Goal of Scene Builder
### Provide an easy option for anyone to make a custom scene for the 3D caves  
#### A lot of staff have requested for customizable background environments  
#### Unity is one method of making scenes for the 3D caves, but it is not very beginner friendly. A web-based environment to create scenes makes it quicker, easier, and more accessible for users to create their own custom scene.
