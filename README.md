# Scene Builder

## Goal
### ➡️ Provide an easy option to make custom scenes for the 3D caves  
#### The staff requested customizable background environments. Unity is one method of making scenes for the 3D caves, but it is not very beginner friendly. A web-based environment to create scenes is quicker, easier, and makes it more accessible for anyone to create their own custom scene.
