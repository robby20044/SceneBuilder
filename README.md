# Scene Builder

<br>

## Goal
### Provide an easy option for anyone to make a custom scene for the 3D caves  
#### The staff have requested for customizable background environments  
#### Unity is one method of making scenes for the 3D caves, but it is not very beginner friendly. A web-based environment to create scenes is quicker, easier, and makes it more accessible for anyone to create their own custom scene. 

#### The user will be able to: 
- select a background image to simulate an environment
    + hospital room
    + home visit
    + outdoors
- bring in other images to layer on top of the background
    + medical equipment
    + interactable objects
- save custom scenes and load them back up

## Current State

#### [Scene Builder](https://robby20044.github.io/SceneBuilder/index.html)

<br><br><br>

## Technologies

#### `three.js` is used to create the customizable scene. The scene has a 64:10 aspect ratio allowing it to span across all four walls of the 3D caves

<br><br><br>

## Challenges

#### ⚠️ Formating the webpage  
#### ⚠️ Proper testing requires being inside the 3D caves
